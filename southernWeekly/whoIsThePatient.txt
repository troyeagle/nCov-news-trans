Who is the patient with "false negative" new coronary pneumonia.
.
.
.
Tan Wei, deputy director of the Hubei Medical Imaging Professional Committee, said CT results are very consistent with the new coronary pneumonia, but nucleic acid test negative about 30-40% of the cases.
.
One patient at a hospital in Hangzhou tested negative for the nucleic acid reagents six times and did not test positive until the seventh time.
.
Multiple front-line physicians have expressed a similar view that the most important factor affecting nucleic acid detection is, first and foremost, sample collection.
.
A pair of couples admitted to a designated hospital in Taizhou who were tested negative for nucleic acid were too scared to let them go. His wife yelled every day, "The country is sure we're not sick and you're keeping me here.. And yelling at the nurse in the isolation ward.

Wu was surprised when she got the result's of the nucleic acid test.
.
In January 2020, Sister Wu and her son, Li Zhe, became ill with fever under their pseudonyms. They took a CT scan of their son at Wuhan Ninth Hospital before testing for nucleic acid. The result was that the twin lung infection was a double-lung infection. There's a glassy shadow. Wu also took a photo twice, saying that she had shown CT results to some doctors. Doctors agree that the highly suspected new coronavirus infection is highly consistent with the condition.
.
The mother and son lived in separate wards for a few days in the observation room. Every time Li Zhe visited his mother, he could see her talking on the phone with a different person, hoping for a nucleic acid test. January 28th and 29th they finally looked forward to the chance to do the nucleic acid test twice in a row. The first day the doctor took a swabs in Wu sister's mouth to take samples the next day. We'll take samples in the nasal cavity.
.
It's just a surprise. Li Zhe's nucleic acid test results are "positive" for the more serious symptoms of the disease, the earlier the onset of illness of the sister Wu is "negative..
.
This is not an exception. In the early years of life, getting a reagent box is "winning the lottery" for the suspected patient. And now it's changed. Even if the symptoms are consistent and CT suggests a pulmonary viral infection, the patient cannot obtain a "positive" diagnosis.
.
That would have been good news but now it is becoming a new concern for the patient.
.
Some patients may be true negative, but others may be negative to positive after several tests. They could not initially be defined as new coronavirus infections, which means that they may have been turned away from hospitals. The disease may suddenly increase the risk of infection among those around it.
.
New Year's Eve Feb comes with a growing number of calls for negative nucleic acid tests on the Web. Tan Wei, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Hubei Medical Imaging Professional Committee, told Southern Weekend Journalist that based on his clinical experience, he believes CT results are very consistent with New Coronary pneumonia but the nucleic acid test is negative in about 30-40% of cases.
.
Li Zhe started hospitalizing Sister Wu and it didn't go so well. She didn't have time for her third nucleic acid test. Nor is it known whether it will turn positive later in the day or night, when the problem of hospitalization becomes more acute.
.
1 The seventh positive test.
.
"I really hope my test results are positive.. Wu said she was unlucky if she was positive. There's a chance we'll be hospitalized.
.
According to her description her condition is deteriorating. When the first CT scan was taken, Sister Wu was able to act as usual. And now she's so dependent on oxygen. Her hospital bed in the observation room was less than three metres from the toilet, but she had to sit for a long time every time she went to the bathroom. Wait until your breath is steady before you dare to walk slowly across it. The nose, the mouth all have to exhale in a big mouth She can hardly hold out even for such a short time to go to the bathroom.
.
Three of the seven members of the Wuxi family have been diagnosed. Grandpa died the night he was diagnosed. The scarce bed space for Grandpa's bed was reserved for the grandmother who was later diagnosed.
.
Wu Xi's cousin Dou Juan was the only negative patient among those who had had a nucleic acid test, but her double lung imaging showed viral inflammation. She became one of Wu Xi's most feared families. Wu Xi said, "Neither of the negative tests can rule out that Li Wenliang was tested positive for the third time..
.
Her Li Wenliang is one of the first "disinformation" doctors to spread the epidemic. Li Wenliang checked the nucleic acid altogether 3 times the first result is unknown the second is negative. Only the third time was positive. That's what he announced on his Twitter account that day, 23 days after he got sick.
.
It's not just Wuhan, the medical director of a designated hospital in Taizhou, Zhejiang, who tells reporters at the weekend. In a video conference on February 3, he listened to provincial experts talking about a hospital in Hangzhou. One patient tested negative for the nucleic acid reagents six times and did not test positive until the seventh time.
.
His hospital had a similar case. A couple who came back from Wuhan with a fever also reported a lung imaging report showing a viral infection but all three tests for nucleic acid were negative.
.
Nor is it alone that several doctors in the affected area confirmed to Southern weekend reporters that there is now a case of a patient testing negative for nucleic acid.
.
A front-line support doctor in Wuhan says many patients in his hospital have clinical symptoms and CT images. Both are consistent with the new coronavirus infection, but these people were less positive for nucleic acid tests. Much more negative. In a statistical sheet obtained by the Southern Weekend Journalists, many negative patients did not undergo a second test.
.
The doctor explained that the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only gave him a limited number of 50 test indicators per day for his hospital. There's nothing the hospital can do about it. There are also patients who have been tested again and some of them remain negative. But there was also one person who turned positive.
.
Many negative patients are applying for a second test. Such was Lin Jun and his mother. Lin Jun's daughter says the tests should be filed with the community for queuing up for approval. But it's too hard to wait. They queued up in the hospital for another nucleic acid test, and Lin Jun heard there were patients who had been tested negative three times, too. It took a fourth time to show positive results.
.
Swabs of the pharyngeal swab with 2 abnormalities.
.
February 3rd Zhang Xiaochun, deputy director of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University video science department of friends screenshots circulated on the network. She thinks CT imaging should be the main basis for the current 2019-n CoV pneumonia screening in Wuhan epidemic area; At the same time, asymptomatic or nucleic acid test negative but CT imaging positive people were isolated. In case it causes a family clustering infection.
.
She told the media that one of the reasons she sent out the circle of friends was that some patients who were diagnosed positive by CT were false negative because of the nucleic acid test results. Missing a diagnosis and returning to your home can eventually cause family clustering.
.
Why is there a "false negative" in the test?
.
The Southern Weekend reporter learned that the detection of the new coronavirus included "sample collection" "viral nucleic acid extraction" "viral nucleic acid detection". Each step has an impact on the outcome.
.
In an interview, multiple front-line physicians expressed a similar view. The most important factor influencing this is first and foremost sample collection. Currently, swabs are the most common way of collecting samples in the oral and nasal cavity.
.
Wang Reich, a front-line medical examiner in Wuhan, said that the industry often said "garbage in, garbage out of the garbage specimen out of the garbage results.. He said the swabs were part of the upper respiratory tract because the new coronavirus was primarily in the lower respiratory tract. The specific operation is to swab the arches of the palate, pharynx and palate tonsils for secretion to obtain specimens. The new coronavirus clinical management guide states that both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens should be tested to improve detection rates but in Wang's observations. The lower respiratory tract specimens are relatively difficult to obtain so many hospitals do not do simultaneous testing.
.
Another front-line doctor said that swabs were the easiest to popularize and operable. Phlegm is not always present and extraction of alveolar lavage involves tracheoscopic inconvenience. And the paramedics are more susceptible to infection.
.
Sampling techniques can also affect detection accuracy. One doctor said that an inexperienced nurse might not be able to obtain a qualified specimen, leading to a false negative. But a more realistic reason lies outside of experience. Tan Wei told Southern Weekend Reporter that the nucleic acid test was first performed by the Hubei CDC. As a result, infected testing has now been extended to more hospitals, and on the one hand there are a lot of unprofessional people testing for it. The sampling area is not deep enough to reach the pharynx more importantly. Some people are afraid that they are too close to be infected and that it is more likely that the samples will not be collected properly.
.
Experimental manipulation is also a possible factor. Wang Reich, who is familiar with in vitro diagnostic reagents, said the new coronavirus test has more operational steps, so the experimenters are more likely to make mistakes. In addition to the very high number of specimens currently being tested on a daily basis, the probability of errors in the operation of a high workload inspector is increased.
.
3 Repeat kit for rush to battle.
.
Another patient is concerned about the performance of the reagent box.
.
Wang Reich said the outbreak began with a lack of capacity in the reagent box. Drug Superintendency has speeded up the approval process for reagent kits Many manufacturers are speeding up research and development to catch up on the market. As a result, the performance of many of the kits was not adequately tested and evaluated. Generally speaking, such a reagent can be used in clinical applications from development to certification. It takes 2-3 years. And the manufacturing process of the reagent box will also affect the quality of each batch of products, which also involves the stability of the detection effectiveness of different batches.
.
The development of the reagent kit was indeed rushed. A staff member at a company designated to produce the reagent told Southern Weekend that it took less than 20 days for the company to develop the product and get its license. At first, the company often worked overtime until early morning, but the workers on the production line never stopped. They have forty or fifty available workers.
.
"All the companies were racing against the clock and everyone would say they were the first to produce it.. Said the staff member. January 26 - The reagent boxes of four domestic companies passed through the NDA's Emergency Approval Channel at record speed. Speeding up deliveries to local centers and hospitals for disease control. The Southern Weekend correspondent understands that the drug control department had previously assigned two reviewers to each company. Provides a 24-hour question-and-answer period to puzzle out all aspects of the approval process.
.
Now, at the end of the Spring Festival holiday season, most of the company's workers return to work three times in the beginning of the year with a capacity of 200,000 people a day. But daily production is based on daily orders from hospitals and disease control centers.
.
When the Southern Weekend reporter asked about the sensitivity of the kit, the other side responded, "We can only express that our kit is highly sensitive and specific. The exact data is difficult for almost all reagent manufacturers to identify.. The staff member says the company has been very busy lately, and the clinical data has not yet been collected.
.
Different companies will also produce different reagent boxes. "Each company has developed a different process for detecting viral nucleic acid sites, with different sources of raw materials for adding reagents. Each kit will certainly perform differently.. Wang reich told southern weekend reporters.
.
Jiang Rongfeng, a member of the National Advisory Committee on Infectious Diseases, suggested that there was another possibility besides sampling and reagent problems. He believes that the detection of the virus is also related to the time of the patient's onset. Generally speaking, one or two days of early onset is not as positive as five or six days. "Even if the reagent is not faulty and the sampling is not faulty, the time of onset can also have an effect on the early viral load. The positive may be low.. Jiang Rongmeng said the same logic holds true for chest CT diagnoses in which some patients were tested positive for nucleic acid. But lung imaging does not show that a patient like this also needs to be isolated for observation.
.
How to treat "negative" patients in Wuhan.
.
On February 2, the Ninth Hospital of Wuhan City informed Sister Wu and some other patients who had been diagnosed as negative that they were being transferred to the hospital. Wu said she was too dependent on the hospital's oxygen supply to wait in the lobby to be transferred. Then she contacted several hospitals herself, and for various reasons she was unable to make the trip.
.
At first, there were seventy or eighty patients in the visiting room with Sister Wu. The positive ones are just a few. There are only eight or nine of them. Sister Wu stayed in the observation room on the fourth floor for a few days. The patients were mostly elderly and most of them had a fever. There are a lot of people who are already having difficulty breathing and are taking oxygen. Other patients close to respiratory failure are still struggling to shout. People die almost every day.
.
The son who is diagnosed as positive by contrast is fortunate.
.
On the night of February 2, the hospital gave Sister Wu an ultimatum that she must leave. Sister Wu won't leave now she won't even get a needle.
.
It was also February 2 in Wuhan New Coronary Pneumonia Control and Control Command required the city's urban areas to carry out "four categories of people" centralized treatment and isolation work. These four categories of persons are close contacts of confirmed patients, suspected patients, patients with fever that cannot be ruled out of the likelihood of infection, and confirmed patients. Many hotels in Wuhan have been converted into New Coronary Pneumonia Isolation Points. During the isolation period, free accommodation, medical observation and treatment are provided in all districts.
.
But the southern weekend reporters know that the main body of centralized segregation is mainly grassroots communities. Many isolated hotels have yet to be implemented, and many do not have medical conditions. Many patients with negative nucleic acid tests but whose condition is still developing are either not placed in isolation or are unwilling to go there themselves.
.
Lin Jun and his mother have been living in a living room with their wives and daughters, who are still asymptomatic and isolated. Lin Jun's daughter told the Southern Weekend reporter that her home in the Hongshan District where the concentration of isolation has not yet moved much. And no one told them to stay at the hotel.
.
Wuxi is also asking the community to coordinate beds for aunts. Wu said she had told a lot about her family and many people about asking for help online. There were a lot of people who contacted her, but she didn't give up on any of the chances, "so I faced you. Tell me again. On the evening of Feb. 4, Wu said to the Southern Weekend reporter.
.
Another patient, Mr. Lee, had a relatively serious lung infection but both tests for nucleic acid were negative. His community wanted to put him in a hotel but they refused because Mr. Lee still needed treatment. There are seven or eight hours a day in a queue at a designated hospital for injections that the community can't solve by just putting them together.
.
On the front line of treatment, Tan Wei described a sad reality. Some patients have a negative first and second nucleic acid test but CT shows a viral infection followed by a CT examination over time. Only to find out it's getting worse. Recheck the nucleic acid and wait until the patient is diagnosed as positive and the condition is aggravated. Can't be saved. Tan Wei points out the reasons behind the current shortage of the relevant medicaments the patient who is not seriously ill has not taken such medications; The undiagnosed patients reached the quarantine point. Some of the isolation sites do not have relevant drugs.
.
Feb. 4 Southern Weekend reporter calls multiple Wuhan community grid workers to ask what to do with patients whose lung images show a viral infection but the nucleic acid test is negative? Said a community grid worker. Nor did they know how to deal with the situation; Others respond that Wuhan has no designated hospital for such cases.
.
Comparison of SARS treatment in that year with changes in SARS epidemiological evidence, corresponding clinical manifestations and lung X-ray imaging in accordance with the 2004 Edition of the Infectious Atypical Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program. And can rule out other disease diagnosticians can make SARS clinical diagnosis. On the basis of the clinical diagnosis, the detection of the pathogen can make a definite diagnosis. In this programme, clinical diagnosis and definitive diagnosis are classified as one level and the other two levels are medical isolation observers and suspected cases, respectively. Such a hierarchy is more liberal than the new coronavirus infection of pneumonia today, and clinically diagnosed patients receive the same level of isolation as those diagnosed.
.
Mr Tan also refers to his own clinical treatment, saying that they primarily use CT for initial diagnosis. "Because the nucleic acid test takes so long, we have to wait a day for the result's of the test. For example, the first time we did a CT scan on a suspected case of mild symptoms. We advise him to go to the isolation site. We'll go to the treatment center if he's heavy. Normally, in five days we'll review the CT to see if there's a change in imaging..
.
5 Other more cautious cities.
.
The patient diagnosis has become a heavy pressure of Wuhan epidemic area each side is looking for a solution. Zhang Xiaochun later also stressed to the medical media from the lilac garden that "Wuhan as an epidemic area cannot completely rely on nucleic acid testing to screen patients at this stage. Achieve the prevention and control effect of cutting off the source of infection. Ordinary scaremongering screening requires differential diagnosis, which CT cannot achieve..
.
In other cities the diagnosis seems more cautious.
.
Shanghai, thousands of miles away, has far fewer infections than Wuhan, where everything is manageable. The nucleic acid test is still performed by the CDC and can be booked daily at the hospital. A ventilator at Shanghai Sanjia Hospital told Southern Weekend Journalists that now strict controls on the detection of nucleic acid are strictly indicated by CT imaging. To check it out. If the image matches the characteristics of viral pneumonia there is an epidemiological history and the leukocytes and lymphocytes are found to be low. "This type of patient cannot be released even if the nucleic acid test is negative for the first time. Even a few days after taking the medicine to check the nucleic acid again there are very few need to check more times.
.
Two cities in Zhejiang, Wenzhou and Taizhou, have gradually become serious epidemic areas. A pair of couples admitted to a designated hospital in Taizhou who were tested negative for nucleic acid did not dare to let them go. "Negative also dare not let them go.. Said the director of the aforementioned medical section. The wife yelled every day," The country is sure we're not sick and you're keeping me here.. And yelling at the nurse in the isolation ward. The nurse felt aggrieved and asked the director to persuade him to talk to the patient for half an hour. To soothe her emotions.
.
The director told the Southern Weekend reporter that although the negative results of the two tests met the criteria for exclusion, they were not clinically excluded. "We usually guide him to indicators such as basically no imaging symptoms or lymphocytes to return to normal and then test for nucleic acids. No problem and you can go home..
.
Several doctors have mentioned that the condition is evolving. The director analyzed the condition of the woman patient, who, although the nucleic acid test was negative, had some of the lesions receding. Another part of the new lesion does not come out all at once.
.
He also felt the pace of nucleic acid testing quickening. Earlier, the nucleic acid test was performed by the CDC in the local city. As the number of patients being tested increases, it becomes the responsibility of the county's centers for disease control and control. And now the county centers for disease control and control can confirm the diagnosis once they have tested positive.
.
Facing a positive doctor is more decisive. A patient's lung CT does not have any abnormalities just because he has a slight cough after returning from Wuhan. Tested positive for nucleic acid. The director mentioned above judged him to be an upper respiratory infection of the coronavirus, although no abnormalities in the lung CT must also be isolated.
.
In fact, experts in disease prevention and control are also debating how to confirm the diagnosis. In an interview with the Southern Weekend Reporter, most experts agree that pathology is best to have a pathological result. This is more difficult in the practical operation of Wuhan. The complexity of the new coronavirus infection requires doctors to synthesize more tests and make more careful judgments. Jiang Rongfeng pointed out to the Southern Weekend reporter that imaging diagnosis can be used as an auxiliary way to "do not perform CT can not necessarily rule out that the performance of the disease is not necessarily the case. From the point of view of clinical diagnosis, imaging is always an auxiliary diagnostic pathway, or it should focus on pathogenic diagnosis..
.
On February 5, the National Board of Health (NHC) released the "New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme". Whether there is a history of epidemiology or not, only the "fever and / or respiratory symptoms" and "early onset total leukocytes are normal or decreased.. Or the lymphocyte count decrease" these 2 clinical manifestations can be considered as suspected cases. More importantly, it adds a new "clinical diagnosis" to the "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", limiting it to the Hubei Province. This means that the results of CT imaging in Hubei Province can be used as the basis for the diagnosis of "clinical cases".
